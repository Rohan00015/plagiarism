Slide 3: Abstract
Our objective is to detect unauthorized copying of content while preserving the original meaning of texts. This ensures intellectual property rights are maintained, fostering academic integrity. Our approach, which incorporates AI, has demonstrated high accuracy in plagiarism detection, making it a reliable tool for academic and professional use.

Slide 4: Introduction
We employ advanced computational linguistics and NLP to analyze content semantics. The goal is to preserve meaning while identifying copied material. This is critical for upholding intellectual integrity in academics and beyond. However, challenges include addressing sophisticated paraphrasing and managing linguistic variations.

Slide 5: Literature Survey
Traditional Methods: Manual text comparison and keyword matching were limited in efficiency and scalability.
AI-Driven Evolution: Modern approaches leverage machine learning for detecting semantic similarity and contextual nuances.
Research Gaps: Current challenges include a lack of robust datasets and real-time applications, which our project aims to address.
Slide 6: Methodology
We utilized a diverse dataset of academic and web-based texts, annotated for plagiarism and paraphrasing instances.
Feature Extraction: Techniques like semantic embeddings and syntactic analysis improve context understanding.
Transformer-Based Models: These deep learning architectures enable advanced analysis of textual data, ensuring sophisticated content evaluation.
Slide 7: Results & Discussion
Our analysis revealed:

High accuracy in detecting plagiarism across varied domains.
Precision was influenced by the complexity of paraphrasing strategies and linguistic diversity.
These findings underscore the need for models adaptable to different domains and datasets.
